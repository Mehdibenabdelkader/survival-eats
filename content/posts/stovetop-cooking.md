# Stovetop Cooking Fundamentals

The stovetop is where most of your cooking will happen, especially as a beginner. Mastering these fundamental techniques will give you the confidence to tackle countless recipes and create your own delicious meals.

## Understanding Heat Control

### Heat Levels and When to Use Them

**High Heat (8-10):**
- Boiling water
- Searing meat
- Stir-frying
- Getting pans hot before adding oil

**Medium-High Heat (6-7):**
- Sautéing vegetables
- Pan-frying
- Browning meat after initial sear
- Cooking pancakes

**Medium Heat (4-5):**
- General cooking
- Scrambling eggs
- Cooking onions until soft
- Simmering with lid off

**Medium-Low Heat (2-3):**
- Gentle simmering
- Melting butter or chocolate
- Cooking garlic (to prevent burning)
- Warming food

**Low Heat (1):**
- Keeping food warm
- Very gentle simmering
- Melting delicate ingredients

### Reading Your Pan
**Visual cues that your pan is ready:**
- A drop of water sizzles and evaporates quickly
- Oil shimmers but doesn't smoke
- You can feel heat when holding your hand 6 inches above the pan

## Essential Stovetop Techniques

### 1. Sautéing
**What it is:** Cooking food quickly in a small amount of fat over medium-high heat.

**Key principles:**
- Heat the pan first, then add oil
- Don't overcrowd the pan
- Keep food moving
- Cut ingredients uniformly for even cooking

**Perfect for:** Vegetables, thin cuts of meat, aromatics like onions and garlic

**Step-by-step:**
1. Heat pan over medium-high heat
2. Add oil when pan is hot
3. Add ingredients when oil shimmers
4. Stir or toss frequently
5. Cook until desired doneness

### 2. Pan-Frying
**What it is:** Cooking food in a moderate amount of fat, typically without moving it much.

**Key principles:**
- Use enough oil to come partway up the sides of the food
- Don't move food too early (let it develop a crust)
- Control temperature to prevent burning

**Perfect for:** Chicken pieces, fish fillets, potatoes, breaded items

**Step-by-step:**
1. Heat oil in pan over medium heat
2. Test oil temperature with a small piece of food
3. Add food carefully to avoid splashing
4. Cook without moving until golden brown
5. Flip once and cook other side

### 3. Boiling and Simmering
**Boiling:** Rapid bubbles, 212°F (100°C)
**Simmering:** Gentle bubbles, 185-200°F (85-93°C)

**When to boil:**
- Pasta
- Potatoes for mashing
- Blanching vegetables
- Hard-boiled eggs

**When to simmer:**
- Rice
- Soups and stews
- Sauces
- Braising liquid

**Tips:**
- Salt pasta water generously (it should taste like seawater)
- Start with boiling, then reduce to simmer
- Partially cover pot to maintain simmer without boiling over

### 4. Steaming
**What it is:** Cooking food with steam from boiling water.

**Benefits:**
- Retains nutrients
- No added fats needed
- Gentle cooking method
- Preserves color and texture

**Simple steaming setup:**
1. Add 1-2 inches of water to pot
2. Place steamer basket or colander in pot
3. Water should not touch bottom of steamer
4. Bring water to boil, add food, cover
5. Steam until tender

### 5. Braising (Stovetop Version)
**What it is:** Combination of searing and slow cooking in liquid.

**Perfect for:** Tough cuts of meat, root vegetables, building complex flavors

**Basic process:**
1. Sear meat or vegetables in pot
2. Add aromatics (onions, garlic, herbs)
3. Add liquid (broth, wine, water) to partially cover
4. Bring to simmer, cover, cook slowly
5. Check periodically and add liquid if needed

## Building Flavor on the Stovetop

### The Foundation: Aromatics
**The holy trinity of cooking:**
- **French:** Onions, carrots, celery
- **Spanish:** Onions, garlic, tomatoes
- **Cajun:** Onions, bell peppers, celery

**How to build flavor:**
1. Start with aromatics in oil
2. Cook until softened and fragrant
3. Add spices and cook briefly
4. Add main ingredients
5. Deglaze pan if needed

### Deglazing
**What it is:** Adding liquid to dissolve browned bits stuck to the pan.

**Why it matters:** Those browned bits (fond) are pure flavor.

**How to do it:**
1. Remove main ingredients from pan
2. Add liquid (wine, broth, water) to hot pan
3. Scrape up browned bits with wooden spoon
4. Let liquid reduce slightly
5. Use as sauce or add back to dish

### Layering Flavors
**Build complexity by:**
- Cooking aromatics first
- Adding spices to bloom in oil
- Browning proteins for depth
- Adding liquids gradually
- Tasting and adjusting seasoning

## Common Stovetop Mistakes

### 1. Not Preheating the Pan
**Problem:** Food sticks, cooks unevenly
**Solution:** Always heat pan before adding oil, oil before adding food

### 2. Overcrowding
**Problem:** Food steams instead of browning
**Solution:** Cook in batches if necessary

### 3. Moving Food Too Much
**Problem:** Prevents proper browning
**Solution:** Let food cook undisturbed until ready to flip

### 4. Wrong Heat Level
**Problem:** Burning outside while inside stays raw, or cooking too slowly
**Solution:** Learn your stove and adjust heat as needed

### 5. Not Tasting as You Go
**Problem:** Under or over-seasoned final dish
**Solution:** Taste frequently and adjust seasoning

## Essential Stovetop Recipes to Master

### 1. Perfect Scrambled Eggs
- Low heat, constant stirring
- Add butter at the end
- Remove from heat while slightly underdone

### 2. Sautéed Vegetables
- High heat, quick cooking
- Season at the end
- Don't overcook

### 3. Pan-Seared Chicken
- Room temperature chicken
- Hot pan, don't move too early
- Use thermometer for doneness

### 4. Basic Rice
- 1:2 ratio (rice to liquid)
- Bring to boil, then simmer covered
- Let rest before fluffing

### 5. Simple Pasta Sauce
- Sauté aromatics
- Add tomatoes and seasonings
- Simmer to concentrate flavors

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Food Sticking to Pan
**Causes:** Pan not hot enough, not enough oil, moving food too early
**Solutions:** Proper preheating, adequate fat, patience

### Uneven Cooking
**Causes:** Pieces different sizes, overcrowding, wrong heat level
**Solutions:** Uniform cutting, cook in batches, adjust temperature

### Burning
**Causes:** Heat too high, not stirring when needed, pan too hot
**Solutions:** Lower heat, stir more frequently, start over if badly burned

### Bland Food
**Causes:** Under-seasoned, not building layers of flavor
**Solutions:** Season throughout cooking, taste and adjust, use aromatics

## Building Confidence

### Start Simple
Begin with basic techniques like scrambled eggs or sautéed vegetables before attempting complex dishes.

### Practice Mise en Place
Have everything prepped and ready before you start cooking. Stovetop cooking often moves quickly.

### Learn Your Equipment
Every stove and pan combination behaves differently. Spend time learning how yours responds to different heat settings.

### Keep Notes
Write down what works and what doesn't. This helps you improve and repeat successes.

### Be Patient
Good stovetop cooking often requires patience - letting onions properly caramelize, allowing meat to develop a good sear, or simmering a sauce to the right consistency.

Mastering these stovetop fundamentals will give you the foundation to cook countless meals with confidence. Remember, cooking is both an art and a science - understanding the principles gives you the freedom to be creative while ensuring consistent, delicious results.
